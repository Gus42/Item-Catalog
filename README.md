# Item-Catalog
Udacity P3, Full Stack - First time with the framework Flask

date: 19/12/2015

Item Catalog is the third project of Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree of Udacity.
In this project I used Python, the framework Flask, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I wrote almost all the code. I copied, with some changes, the functions of login and logout.
